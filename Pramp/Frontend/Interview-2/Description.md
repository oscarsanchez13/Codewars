# Flip Counter

Build a flip counter that counts a minute (0-59) iteratively.

If you can, try and minimize the creation of new DOM elements in runtime, by reusing the same elements.

**Example:**

**Additional Questions**

- Ask your peer if they can think of a way to avoid creating new DOM elements.
- Ask your peer to describe how they might achieve the flip effect, prior to actually writing the code.
- Suggest to have separate “up” and “down” elements for each digit component, to achieve the flip transition.
